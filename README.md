# Overview

Project Euler is a platform with more than 700 algorithmic problems of different difficulty level.

The main idea is to write an effective algorithm that will be able to obtain a solution in quite reasonable amount of time (less than 1 minute on a modestly powered computer).

In this repository I am going to share my way of thinking on some of these problems and how I solved them step by step.
